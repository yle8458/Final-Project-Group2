All the code we implemented are located in the Code folder.

The EfficientDet.py is the main scripts we implemented for the EfficientDet and used for our prediction. 

The baseline.py is a reference code we initial used, it used the efficientNet as backbone, and a Unet to predict the results. 

The centernet.py is a centernet implementation for this project, but there are bugs and is not used at last.

To download the dataset and run the code, please refer to the readme.md in the code folder.

The prediction.csv is our output results.
